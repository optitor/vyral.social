**BEFORE FILING ANY LEGAL CLAIM, YOU MUST FIRST CONTACT VYRAL'S SUPPORT TEAM AT [SUPPORT EMAIL] TO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY.** Include your name, account email, description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. You must make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute through this process for 60 days before proceeding to arbitration or court.

VYRAL commits to responding to informal dispute requests within 14 business days and working in good faith toward resolution.

### 13.2 Binding Arbitration Agreement

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND VYRAL HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.**

You and VYRAL agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and VYRAL arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms, the Platform, VCoins, or your relationship with VYRAL (collectively, "Disputes") will be resolved by binding arbitration as described in this section, rather than in court, except that:

**Exceptions to Arbitration:**

- You may bring an individual action in small claims court if the claim qualifies and remains in small claims court
- Either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in court to protect intellectual property rights
- Either party may seek injunctive relief to enforce this arbitration agreement
- Disputes about the enforceability, validity, or scope of this arbitration agreement must be decided by a court

### 13.3 Arbitration Procedure

**Arbitration Rules:**
Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this Section. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.

**Initiating Arbitration:**
To begin arbitration, you must send a written Demand for Arbitration to:

- AAA at its case filing services (contact information at www.adr.org)
- VYRAL at [LEGAL ADDRESS]

Your Demand must include:

- Your name, address, phone number, and email
- Description of the dispute with reasonable detail
- Amount of damages sought (if any)
- Relief requested

VYRAL will similarly provide notice if it initiates arbitration against you.

**Arbitrator Selection:**
A single arbitrator will be selected according to the AAA Rules. The arbitrator must:

- Be a lawyer with at least 10 years of experience or a retired judge
- Have experience with technology, blockchain, or financial services disputes (where possible)
- Be neutral and independent

Both parties will have input into arbitrator selection under the AAA Rules.

**Arbitration Costs:**

- **If your claim is for $10,000 or less:** VYRAL will pay all arbitration filing, administration, and arbitrator fees unless the arbitrator finds your claim was filed for harassment or is frivolous
- **If your claim is for more than $10,000:** Fees will be allocated according to the AAA Rules (typically split between parties)
- **Each party bears its own attorneys' fees** unless the arbitrator awards them under applicable law or these Terms
- **If VYRAL initiates arbitration against you:** VYRAL will pay all arbitration fees regardless of claim amount

**Arbitration Location:**

- If in-person hearing is required, it will take place in the federal judicial district where you reside, unless both parties agree otherwise
- You may also choose to have arbitration conducted by telephone, video conference, or based on written submissions

**Arbitration Award:**
The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.

The arbitrator's decision and award are final and binding, with very limited exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

**Confidentiality:**
Arbitration proceedings and awards are confidential, except as necessary to enforce or challenge the award or as required by law.

### 13.4 Class Action Waiver

**YOU AND VYRAL AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.**

**You and VYRAL expressly waive any ability to:**

- Maintain any class action, consolidated action, or representative action in arbitration or in court
- Participate in any class action, consolidated action, or representative action brought by any other person
- Serve as a class representative or private attorney general
- Join your claims with those of any other person

**Severability of Class Action Waiver:**
If a court or arbitrator determines that the Class Action Waiver in this Section 13.4 is unenforceable for any reason, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the entire arbitration agreement in Section 13 shall be null and void (but the rest of these Terms remain in effect). In that case, any remaining Disputes will be resolved in court under Section 14.

**Exception for Mass Arbitrations:** See Section 13.5 for special procedures if 25 or more similar claims are filed.

### 13.5 Mass Arbitration Protocol

If 25 or more similar arbitration demands are filed against VYRAL within 180 days that raise similar issues and have the same or coordinated counsel ("Mass Filing"), the parties agree to the following protocol:

**Stage 1 - Bellwether Process:**

1. Counsel for claimants and VYRAL will each select 5 cases (10 total) to proceed as "bellwether" cases
2. Only those 10 cases will be filed with AAA and proceed to arbitration
3. All other cases will be stayed and filing fees tolled pending resolution of the bellwethers
4. The bellwether arbitrations will be processed in order, with awards issued for each case
5. After all bellwether awards are issued, the parties will engage in a global mediation session to resolve all remaining cases

**Stage 2 - Global Mediation:**

1. A single mediator (agreed upon or appointed by AAA) will conduct a settlement conference
2. Parties will negotiate in good faith for 60 days
3. VYRAL will make a good faith settlement offer based on bellwether results
4. If global settlement is reached, all cases settle under agreed terms

**Stage 3 - Proceeding with Remaining Cases:**

1. If no global settlement is reached after good faith mediation, the process may repeat with 10 new bellwether cases
2. Or parties may agree to arbitrate all cases in batches with streamlined procedures
3. Or any party may seek court intervention to manage the mass filing

**Fee Allocation for Mass Filings:**

- VYRAL will pay all AAA fees for the bellwether cases
- If bellwethers result in settlement, VYRAL will refund reasonable filing fees paid by claimants who settle
- If process proceeds to Stage 3, normal fee allocation under Section 13.3 applies

### 13.6 Right to Opt Out of Arbitration

**YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.**

If you do not want to be subject to this arbitration agreement, you may opt out by sending written notice to:

VYRAL - Arbitration Opt-Out  
[LEGAL ADDRESS]  
Email: legal@vyral.social

Your opt-out notice must be sent **within 30 days of first accepting these Terms** (i.e., first creating an account or using the Platform).

Your opt-out notice must include:

- Your name and account email address
- Clear statement: "I opt out of the arbitration agreement"
- Your signature (electronic signature acceptable)

**Effect of Opting Out:**

- Applies only to this arbitration agreement; all other Terms remain in full effect
- Does not affect any previous arbitration agreements with VYRAL (if applicable)
- Must be sent individually (no group or class opt-outs)
- Is permanent and cannot be revoked

If you opt out, you and VYRAL may only bring claims against each other in court as provided in Section 14.

### 13.7 Severability

If any portion of this Section 13 is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced, **except** that if the Class Action Waiver (Section 13.4) is found unenforceable, then the entire arbitration agreement shall be null and void as provided in Section 13.4.

### 13.8 Changes to Arbitration Terms

Notwithstanding Section 1.2, if VYRAL makes any material changes to this Section 13 after you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject the change by sending written notice to [LEGAL ADDRESS] within 30 days of the change.

If you reject the change:

- The prior arbitration provisions will continue to apply to any Disputes between you and VYRAL
- You may choose to close your account and withdraw your VCoins without penalty
- Or you may continue using the Platform under the prior arbitration terms

### 13.9 Survival

This arbitration agreement survives termination of your account and these Terms.

### 14.1 Governing Law

These Terms and any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Platform shall be governed by and construed in accordance with:

- The laws of the State of Wyoming (for corporate and contract matters)
- The Federal Arbitration Act (for arbitration matters)
- Federal law where applicable (securities, money transmission, etc.)

Without regard to conflict of law provisions.

### 14.2 Jurisdiction for Non-Arbitrable Claims

For any claims not subject to arbitration (as described in Section 13.2), you and VYRAL agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Cheyenne, Laramie County, Wyoming.

**Venue:** Any legal action must be brought in Laramie County, Wyoming, which is the county where VYRAL's registered office is located.

### 14.3 Waiver of Jury Trial

**TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND VYRAL WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL FOR ANY DISPUTES THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION.**

### 14.4 Inconvenient Forum Waiver

**You acknowledge that Delaware may be an inconvenient forum for resolving disputes.** By agreeing to these Terms, you waive any objection to venue in Delaware and any claim that Delaware is an inconvenient forum.

However, if a court determines that enforcing this jurisdiction clause would be unconscionable or fundamentally unfair given the circumstances of your dispute, the court may transfer the case to a more appropriate venue.

## 6. ENCRYPTED MESSAGING PRIVACY

### 6.1 How Encryption Works

**End-to-End Encryption (E2E):**
VYRAL messages use Signal Protocol (same as Signal and WhatsApp):
Your Device → Encrypted → Internet → Encrypted → Recipient Device
↑ ↓
Only you can encrypt Only they can decrypt

**What This Means:**

- Messages encrypted on YOUR device before sending
- Only the recipient can decrypt and read
- VYRAL servers cannot read message content
- Even if compelled by law, we cannot provide plaintext
- Even our employees cannot read your messages
- Even if hackers breach our servers, messages stay encrypted

**Technical Details:**

- AES-256 encryption (military-grade)
- Perfect forward secrecy (past messages stay secure if keys compromised)
- Authenticated encryption (prevents tampering)
- Key ratcheting (new keys for each message)

### 6.2 What We CAN See

Even with E2E encryption, we see:

- Who you message (usernames)
- When messages sent (timestamps)
- Message size (approximate length)
- Whether message delivered/read
- Attachment presence (but not content)

**Metadata We Collect:**

- Sender and recipient usernames
- Timestamp
- Message ID
- Delivery status
- Approximate message size

**Why We Need This:**

- Deliver messages to correct recipient
- Show delivery confirmations
- Detect spam and abuse patterns
- Troubleshoot delivery issues

### 6.3 What We CANNOT See

We CANNOT access:

- ❌ Message text content
- ❌ Shared photos, videos, files
- ❌ Voice messages
- ❌ Any content inside encrypted messages

**Legal Requests:**
If served with valid warrant/subpoena, we can only provide:

- Metadata (who, when, how often)
- Account information
- Public posts
- We CANNOT provide message content (impossible)

### 6.4 Group Messages

Group messages also encrypted end-to-end:

- Each member has encryption keys
- All members can read messages
- VYRAL still cannot read content
- Group metadata visible (members, timestamps)

**Group Limitations:**

- If member leaves, they keep past messages
- If member removed, they keep history up to removal
- We cannot remotely delete messages from devices

### 6.5 Backup and Recovery

**Cloud Backups (Optional):**
You can enable encrypted cloud backup:

- Backed up to your iCloud/Google Drive
- Protected by your backup password
- VYRAL cannot access these backups
- If you lose backup password, messages are unrecoverable

**No Backup Option:**
If you don't enable backup:

- Messages only on your device
- If you lose device, messages lost forever
- We cannot recover them (don't have keys)

### 6.6 When Encryption Doesn't Apply

**Not encrypted:**

- Username (visible to everyone)
- Profile information (public or semi-public)
- Group membership (visible to group)
- Typing indicators
- Online status

### 6.7 Reporting and Safety

**Handling Illegal Content:**

- Users can report messages by screenshot
- Reported messages reviewed by human moderators
- Reporter must share content (we can't see it otherwise)
- Serious violations reported to law enforcement
- Accounts may be terminated for violations

**Cannot Proactively Scan:**

- We cannot scan messages for illegal content
- We rely on user reports
- Trade-off between privacy and safety
- This is intentional design choice

## 9. BLOCKCHAIN AND PUBLIC DATA

### 9.1 Blockchain Fundamentals

**What is Blockchain:**
A public, permanent ledger where all VCoin transactions are recorded.

**Key Properties:**

- **Public:** Anyone can view
- **Permanent:** Cannot be deleted or modified
- **Decentralized:** No single entity controls it
- **Transparent:** All transactions visible

### 9.2 What's Public on Blockchain

When you use VCoins, the following is PERMANENTLY and PUBLICLY recorded:

**Transaction Data:**

- Wallet addresses (sender and receiver)
- Amount of VCoins transferred
- Timestamp of transaction
- Transaction fee paid
- Smart contract interactions

**Example Transaction:**
From: 7xKx...m9Tz (your wallet address) To: 9bPy...k3Qw (recipient wallet) Amount: 100 VCOIN Time: 2025-01-15 14:32:07 UTC Fee: 0.000005 SOL

**Anyone Can See:**

- Your wallet address
- How many VCoins you have
- All your transactions
- Who you transacted with
- When and how much

**Visible On:**

- Solana blockchain explorers (Solscan, Solana Explorer)
- DEX trading interfaces
- Any blockchain analysis tool

### 9.3 Pseudonymity vs Anonymity

**Pseudonymous (Not Anonymous):**

Your blockchain address is pseudonymous:

- Like a username, not directly tied to your real identity
- But can be linked to you if:
  - You withdraw to known exchange account
  - You share your address publicly
  - You purchase VCoins with credit card tied to name
  - Someone analyzes patterns and connects to you

**Blockchain Analysis:**
Sophisticated tools can:

- Trace transaction flows
- Cluster addresses belonging to same person
- De-anonymize users through patterns
- Link blockchain activity to real identity

**We Cannot:**

- Delete your blockchain transactions
- Hide your transactions from public view
- Make past transactions anonymous
- Control what's on blockchain

### 9.4 Linking On-Chain and Off-Chain Data

**What We Know:**

- Your VYRAL username
- Your custodial wallet address
- Your blockchain transactions
- Your withdrawal addresses

**Privacy Implication:**
If someone knows your VYRAL username and blockchain address:

- They can see all your VCoin activity
- They can track your earnings
- They can see who you tip
- They can monitor your balance

**Mitigation:**

- Use different wallets for different purposes
- Withdraw to privacy-enhanced wallets
- Don't publicize your wallet addresses
- Use username that doesn't reveal identity

### 9.5 Off-Chain Privacy (What's Private)

**Stored in Our Systems (Private):**

- Your VYRAL username
- Custodial balance details
- Internal transaction history
- Reward calculations
- Pending transactions

**Can Be Deleted:**
Upon account closure, we delete:

- Username/wallet linkage
- Internal transaction records
- Custodial balance records
- Associated metadata

**But Blockchain Records Remain:**

- Your past transactions stay public
- Cannot be deleted or hidden
- Permanent historical record

### 9.6 Withdrawal Address Privacy

**When You Withdraw:**
You provide external wallet address:

- We record this address
- It's linked to your account
- Appears on blockchain
- Connection is permanent

**Privacy Tips:**

- Use new address for each withdrawal
- Don't reuse addresses
- Use hardware wallet for privacy
- Consider privacy-focused wallets

### 9.7 Marketplace and Public Transactions

**Marketplace Purchases:**
Visible on blockchain:

- That transaction occurred
- Amount paid in VCoins
- Wallet addresses involved

**Not visible on blockchain:**

- What was purchased
- Shipping address
- Buyer/seller names

**Stored in Our System:**

- Item details
- Buyer/seller info
- Shipping details
- Can be deleted upon account closure

### 9.8 DEX Trading Privacy

**After DEX Launch:**

Trading on decentralized exchanges:

- All trades public on blockchain
- Trading patterns visible
- Wallet balances public
- Cannot hide trading activity

**Liquidity Pool:**

- Our liquidity wallet addresses public
- Amounts deposited visible
- Anyone can verify backing

### 9.9 Your Blockchain Privacy Rights

**What You CAN Do:**

- ✅ Use multiple wallet addresses
- ✅ Withdraw to private wallets
- ✅ Delete VYRAL account (off-chain data)
- ✅ Keep username/wallet unlinkable
- ✅ Use privacy tools (coin mixers, etc.)

**What You CANNOT Do:**

- ❌ Delete blockchain transactions
- ❌ Hide past transactions
- ❌ Make public data private retroactively
- ❌ Prevent others from viewing blockchain

**Our Limits:**

- We cannot control blockchain
- We cannot delete immutable data
- We cannot hide public information
- We can only control off-chain data

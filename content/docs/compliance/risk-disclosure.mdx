## 3. GENERAL RISK WARNINGS

### 3.1 Risk of Total Loss

**YOU COULD LOSE ALL MONEY INVESTED IN VCOINS.**

This is not hyperbole. VCoins could become completely worthless if:

- VYRAL platform shuts down permanently
- Regulatory action prohibits VCoin operation
- Smart contract vulnerability is exploited
- Market loses all confidence in VCoin
- Technology becomes obsolete
- Competition makes VYRAL irrelevant
- Business model fails
- Unforeseen catastrophic events occur

**Historical Examples:**
Thousands of tokens and platforms have failed, leaving holders with worthless tokens. VYRAL and VCoin could suffer the same fate.

**No Safety Net:**

- No FDIC insurance
- No government bailout
- No guaranteed buyer
- No minimum value
- No compensation for losses

### 3.2 High Volatility

**VCoin's value may change dramatically and unpredictably.**

**Potential Volatility:**

- ¬±50% price swings in single day
- ¬±90% price swings over weeks/months
- Sudden crashes with no recovery
- Extreme pump-and-dump cycles
- Manipulation by large holders ("whales")
- Flash crashes from technical issues

**Causes of Volatility:**

- Low liquidity (small trades move price significantly)
- Speculative trading (not fundamental value-driven)
- Market sentiment and hype cycles
- News and rumors (true or false)
- Broader crypto market movements
- Platform developments (good or bad)
- Regulatory announcements
- Whale manipulation
- Smart contract events

**Example Scenario:**
VCoin trades at $0.10 today. Tomorrow it could be $0.05 (50% loss) or $0.20 (100% gain). Next week it could be $0.01 (90% loss from today). These extreme moves are possible and have occurred in similar tokens.

### 3.3 Speculative Nature

**VCoin's market price is driven primarily by speculation, not fundamental value.**

**What This Means:**

- Price reflects what people THINK it might be worth in future
- Not based on rational valuation models
- Subject to hype, fear, and manipulation
- "Greater fool theory" - price depends on finding someone willing to pay more
- Bubbles and crashes common in speculative markets

**You Are Speculating If:**

- You purchase hoping price increases
- You plan to sell at higher price for profit
- You're influenced by hype or FOMO
- You expect VCoin to "moon" or 10x
- You're treating VCoin as investment

**Remember:** Speculation is high-risk gambling on future price movements. Most speculators lose money.

### 3.4 No Guarantees

**We make ZERO guarantees about:**

‚ùå VCoin price or value (up, down, or stable)  
‚ùå Platform will continue operating  
‚ùå You can withdraw or sell VCoins  
‚ùå Liquidity will be available  
‚ùå Features will remain unchanged  
‚ùå Regulatory status will stay favorable  
‚ùå Technology will work as intended  
‚ùå Security against all threats  
‚ùå VCoin will have any utility in future  
‚ùå Any particular outcome whatsoever

**Everything is subject to change, failure, or termination without notice or compensation.**

### 3.5 Suitability

**VCoins may NOT be suitable for you if:**

üö´ You cannot afford to lose your investment completely  
üö´ You need stable, predictable returns  
üö´ You're saving for essential expenses (rent, medical, education)  
üö´ You don't understand blockchain technology  
üö´ You're risk-averse or investing conservatively  
üö´ You're expecting guaranteed profits  
üö´ You're under financial pressure or debt  
üö´ You're investing money you'll need soon  
üö´ You haven't consulted financial, legal, or tax advisors

**Recommended User Profile:**

- Can afford complete loss of amount invested
- Understands and accepts high risk
- Has emergency savings separate from VCoin
- Educated about cryptocurrency and blockchain
- Making informed, voluntary decision
- Treating VCoin as entertainment/utility, not investment

---

## 4. PRICE & MARKET RISKS

### 4.1 Price Volatility (Detailed)

**VCoin's price could experience:**

**Extreme Daily Volatility:**

- 10-50%+ price swings within 24 hours
- Flash crashes (sudden, severe drops)
- Flash pumps (sudden, unsustainable spikes)
- Circuit breaker-worthy moves (if they existed)

**Causes of Extreme Volatility:**

- Low liquidity (order book depth insufficient)
- Large trades ("whale" activity)
- Market manipulation (pump-and-dump schemes)
- Bot trading and algorithms
- News catalysts (platform updates, regulatory news)
- Social media hype or FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt)
- Broader crypto market correlation
- Technical issues (platform downtime, smart contract bugs)

**Real-World Example:**
Token launches at $0.01. Within 24 hours it could:

- Pump to $0.10 (10x) due to hype
- Crash to $0.001 (90% loss) as hype fades
- Stabilize at $0.02 (2x from launch)
- Drop to $0 if platform fails

All scenarios have occurred in crypto markets.

### 4.2 Liquidity Risk

**You may not be able to sell VCoins when you want, at any price.**

**Liquidity Problems:**

**Before DEX Launch:**

- No public market for VCoin
- Can only use within VYRAL platform
- Cannot easily convert to fiat
- Must wait for DEX launch to trade freely

**After DEX Launch:**

- Liquidity pool may be shallow
- Large sells cause significant "slippage" (price impact)
- In extreme scenarios, no buyers at any price
- Orders may not fill
- Wide bid-ask spreads

**Slippage Example:**
You want to sell $10,000 worth of VCoins. Due to low liquidity:

- First $1,000: Sells at $0.10
- Next $3,000: Sells at $0.09 (10% worse)
- Next $6,000: Sells at $0.07 (30% worse)
- **Result:** Instead of $10,000, you receive ~$8,200 (18% loss from slippage alone)

**Worst Case:**
No buyers exist at any price. Your VCoins cannot be sold. You're stuck holding worthless tokens.

### 4.3 Market Manipulation

**VCoin market is susceptible to manipulation by large holders or coordinated groups.**

**Manipulation Tactics:**

**Pump-and-Dump:**

- Coordinated buying drives price up artificially
- Late buyers enter due to FOMO
- Early buyers sell at peak
- Price crashes, leaving late buyers with losses

**Wash Trading:**

- Same entity buying and selling to create fake volume
- Makes market appear more active than it is
- Misleads traders about liquidity

**Spoofing:**

- Large orders placed and canceled to fake demand
- Tricks algorithms and other traders
- Manipulates price direction

**Whale Manipulation:**

- Large holders ("whales") can move price dramatically
- Single large sell order can crash price
- Can prevent others from selling profitably

**FUD Campaigns:**

- Spreading false negative information
- Driving panic selling
- Buying back at lower prices

**You Have No Protection:**

- No market manipulation laws for VCoin (decentralized)
- No trading halts or circuit breakers
- No regulatory oversight of DEX trading
- Limited recourse against manipulators

### 4.4 Correlation Risk

**VCoin's price may correlate with broader cryptocurrency market.**

**What This Means:**

- When Bitcoin crashes, VCoin likely crashes harder
- Crypto bear markets affect all tokens
- "Alt season" pumps may not be sustained
- Broader market sentiment drives VCoin sentiment

**Example:**
Bitcoin drops 50% due to regulatory news. VCoin, despite no VYRAL-specific issues, may drop 70-90% due to:

- Reduced crypto market liquidity
- Risk-off sentiment
- Investors exiting all crypto positions
- Correlation trading by algorithms

**You Cannot Diversify This Risk:**

- VCoin is crypto; cannot escape crypto risk
- Diversifying into other tokens doesn't eliminate systemic crypto risk
- Only diversifying outside crypto reduces exposure

### 4.5 Pump & Dump Schemes

**VCoin could be targeted by pump-and-dump schemes.**

**How It Works:**

1. Coordinated group accumulates VCoins at low price
2. Group promotes VCoin heavily (social media, influencers, fake news)
3. FOMO buyers drive price up 10x-100x
4. Group dumps holdings at peak
5. Price crashes 90%+, leaving late buyers with massive losses

**Warning Signs:**

- Sudden unexplained price spikes
- Coordinated social media campaigns
- Promises of "guaranteed" gains
- "Last chance" urgency messaging
- Influencer promotions (often paid)
- Private groups promising insider info

**You Are Vulnerable:**

- These schemes are common in low-liquidity tokens
- Very difficult to detect until too late
- No regulatory protection
- VYRAL cannot prevent this on DEX

**Protection:**

- Don't buy based on hype or FOMO
- Don't trust "insider" information
- Don't chase rapid price increases
- Understand you could be exit liquidity for manipulators

- Blockchain records remain but tokens have no value
- No compensation or refunds

**Historical Precedent:**
Most startups fail (90% within 5 years). Most crypto projects fail. VYRAL could fail.

### 5.2 Platform Changes Risk

**VYRAL may change features, fees, or economics, affecting VCoin value or utility.**

**Possible Changes:**

**Fee Increases:**

- Tip fee increases from 20% to 40%
- Withdrawal fee increases from 2% to 5%
- New fees introduced
- **Impact:** VCoin becomes less valuable, less used

**Feature Removal:**

- Marketplace discontinued
- Tipping disabled
- Premium features changed
- **Impact:** VCoin utility decreases, value drops

**Economic Changes:**

- Reward rates reduced
- Deflationary burns stopped
- Token supply increased (if mint authority reactivated, though currently disabled)
- **Impact:** VCoin value affected

**Policy Changes:**

- Cannot operate independently of VYRAL
- VCoins worthless without VYRAL platform

**Mitigation (Partial):**

- Can withdraw VCoins to self-custody
- Can trade on decentralized exchanges (post-DEX launch)
- **But:** VCoins still require VYRAL platform for utility

### 5.5 Key Person Risk

**VYRAL's success depends on key individuals (founders, developers, team).**

**Risks:**

- Founder(s) leave or pass away
- Key developers quit
- Team conflicts destroy company
- Inability to hire/retain talent
- Burnout or health issues

**If Key People Leave:**

- **But:** Zero-day exploits still possible
- **But:** Audits don't guarantee security

**If Exploit Occurs:**

- VCoins may be stolen or lost
- Platform may shut down
- VCoin value may drop to zero
- No guarantee of recovery or compensation
- No "undo" button on blockchain

### 6.2 Blockchain Risk

**VCoin operates on Solana blockchain. Blockchain issues affect VCoin.**

**Solana-Specific Risks:**

**Network Outages:**

- Solana has experienced multiple outages (hours to days)
- During outages: Cannot transfer VCoins, DEX trading stops
- Causes: Bugs, denial-of-service attacks, validator issues
- **Impact:** Funds locked until network restored

**Network Congestion:**

- High activity causes slow transaction processing
- Transactions fail or take hours
- Higher fees (gas costs)
- **Impact:** Cannot use VCoins reliably

- **Impact:** VCoins permanently trapped on dead blockchain

**Migration Difficulty:**

- Moving VCoin to different blockchain is extremely complex
- Requires new smart contract, token swap, user migration
- May not be feasible or timely
- Users may lose tokens in migration

**You Cannot:**

- Control Solana blockchain
- Prevent network outages
- Fix protocol issues
- Guarantee Solana's future

### 6.3 Private Key Risk

**If you withdraw VCoins to self-custody, you're responsible for security.**

**Private Key Risks:**

**Loss:**

- Lose private keys ‚Üí lose VCoins permanently (no recovery)
- Forget password/seed phrase ‚Üí locked out forever
- Hardware wallet breaks ‚Üí funds gone (if no backup)
- Death without sharing keys ‚Üí family cannot access
- **Result:** VCoins permanently lost, no one can recover

**Theft:**

- **Result:** VCoins lost or stolen

**No Safety Net:**

- No "forgot password" recovery
- No customer service to help
- No way to reverse transactions
- No insurance for user error
- Blockchain transactions are final and irreversible

**Custodial vs Self-Custody Trade-off:**

- **Custodial (default):** VYRAL manages keys, you trust platform security
- **Self-Custody (withdraw):** You manage keys, responsible for security
- Both have risks; neither is completely safe

### 6.4 Technical Obsolescence

**Blockchain technology may become obsolete, making VCoin outdated.**

**Obsolescence Risks:**

**Better Technology:**

- Faster, cheaper blockchains emerge
- Ethereum scaling solutions surpass Solana
- New token standards make SPL-2022 obsolete
- **Impact:** VCoin outdated, cannot compete

**Quantum Computing:**

- Quantum computers could break current encryption

- Chargebacks impossible (unlike credit cards)
- **No protection once transaction confirmed**

**Smart Contract Interactions:**

- Approve malicious contract ‚Üí can drain your wallet
- Interact with buggy contract ‚Üí funds may be lost
- Cannot undo approvals retroactively
- **Must be extremely careful with every transaction**

**Marketplace Issues:**

- Pay seller who doesn't ship ‚Üí VCoins gone (must use VYRAL dispute system, not blockchain)
- Receive wrong item ‚Üí cannot chargeback
- Platform must mediate; blockchain cannot help

### 8.3 Malware & Device Compromise

**Your device could be infected with malware designed to steal cryptocurrency.**

**Malware Types:**

**Keyloggers:**

- Records everything you type
- Steals passwords and seed phrases
- **Result:** Account compromised

**Clipboard Hijackers:**

- Replaces copied wallet addresses with attacker's address
- You think you're sending to correct address
- **Result:** VCoins sent to attacker

**Screen Capture:**

- Takes screenshots of seed phrases or keys
- **Result:** Wallet compromised

**Remote Access Trojans (RATs):**

- Attacker controls your device remotely
- Can access wallets, transfer funds
- **Result:** Total account compromise

**Protection:**

- Keep devices updated
- Use antivirus software
- Don't download suspicious files
- Don't click suspicious links
- Use hardware wallet for large amounts
- Consider separate device for crypto

**If Device Compromised:**

## 9. LIQUIDITY RISKS

### 9.1 Inability to Sell

**You may not be able to sell VCoins when you want to.**

**Before DEX Launch:**

- No public market exists
- Can only use VCoins on VYRAL platform
- Cannot convert to fiat easily
- Must wait for DEX launch (timing uncertain)

**After DEX Launch:**

- Liquidity pool may be insufficient
- No willing buyers at acceptable price
- Order book too thin
- Large orders cannot be filled

**Withdrawal Restrictions:**

- Minimum withdrawal amounts
- Processing delays (24-72 hours)
- Potential delays for large withdrawals (>$10K)
- KYC required for large amounts
- Platform may suspend withdrawals during issues

**Market Conditions:**

- During crashes, no buyers exist
- Everyone trying to sell, no one buying
- Prices drop precipitously
- Cannot exit position
- **Result:** Forced to hold or sell at massive loss

**Lock-Up Periods:**

- Platform may implement lock-up periods for certain VCoins (earned, purchased)
- Cannot access VCoins immediately
- **Currently:** Not implemented, but Terms allow platform to change policies

### 9.2 Slippage Risk

**When you sell VCoins, you may receive much less than expected due to low liquidity.**

**Slippage Explained:**
Your sell order "slips" down the order book, executing at progressively worse prices.

**Example:**
Order Book (simplified):

- Buy orders at $0.10: $1,000 available
- Buy orders at $0.09: $2,000 available
- Buy orders at $0.08: $3,000 available
- Buy orders at $0.07: $5,000 available

You want to sell $10,000 worth:

- First $1,000 sells at $0.10
- Next $2,000 sells at $0.09
- Next $3,000 sells at $0.08
- Last $4,000 sells at $0.07

**Average Price:** ~$0.08 (20% worse than expected $0.10)
**You Receive:** ~$8,000 instead of expected $10,000

**Slippage Increases With:**

- Larger order size
- Lower liquidity
- Volatile markets
- Sudden selling pressure

**Protection (Partial):**

- Limit orders (may not fill)
- Sell in smaller chunks (takes time, price may drop further)
- Use DEX aggregators (helps find best price)
- **But:** Cannot eliminate slippage risk completely

### 9.3 Liquidity Pool Risks

**VYRAL's liquidity pool on DEX could be drained or exploited.**

**Liquidity Pool Mechanics:**

- VYRAL deposits USDC + VCoins into Raydium pool
- Provides liquidity for trading
- Acts as counterparty to all trades

**Risks:**

**Impermanent Loss:**

- If VCoin price changes significantly, VYRAL's pool balance changes
- Could be unprofitable for VYRAL to maintain pool
- VYRAL may withdraw liquidity
- **Result:** No liquidity, VCoins cannot be traded

**Pool Exploitation:**

- Flash loan attacks
- Sandwich attacks
- Front-running
- **Result:** Pool drained, no liquidity

**VYRAL Liquidity Withdrawal:**

- VYRAL faces financial problems
- Withdraws liquidity to cover costs
- **Result:** No market for VCoins

**Smart Contract Bug:**

- Liquidity pool contract exploited
- Funds stolen from pool
- **Result:** No liquidity

**If Liquidity Disappears:**

- Cannot sell VCoins on DEX
- Price crashes to zero
- Stuck holding worthless tokens

### 9.4 Market Depth

**The VCoin market may be "thin" (low trading volume, few orders).**

**Thin Market Characteristics:**

- Wide bid-ask spreads (large gap between buy and sell prices)
- Low daily trading volume
- Few active traders
- Large orders move price dramatically

**Problems with Thin Markets:**

- Cannot sell large amounts without crashing price
- High slippage
- Price manipulation easier
- Volatile price movements
- May not be able to sell at all

**Example:**
You hold $100,000 worth of VCoins. Daily trading volume is $10,000.

- Your sell would be 10x daily volume
- Would crash price significantly
- Might take days/weeks to exit position
- Final amount received much less than expected

**Comparison to Thick Markets:**
Bitcoin: $30+ billion daily volume (thick, liquid)
VCoin: May have < $1 million daily volume (thin, illiquid)

**Result:** Bitcoin easy to buy/sell large amounts; VCoin very difficult

---

## 10. TAX & REPORTING RISKS

### 10.1 Tax Liability

**You are responsible for all taxes on VCoin transactions. Tax liability may be higher than expected.**

**Taxable Events (US):**

**Buying VCoins:**

- Generally not taxable
- Establishes cost basis

**Earning VCoins:**

- Ordinary income at fair market value when received
- Must report on tax return
- Owed even if you don't sell

**Selling VCoins:**

- Capital gain/loss = Sale price - Purchase price
- Short-term capital gains (held < 1 year): Ordinary income rates (up to 37%)
- Long-term capital gains (held 1+ years): 0%, 15%, or 20% based on income

**Using VCoins:**

- Each purchase is taxable event
- Must calculate gain/loss on each transaction
- Example: Buy VCoin at $0.10, spend at $0.20 ‚Üí $0.10 capital gain per coin

**Tipping:**

- Recipient: Ordinary income (must report)
- Sender: Potential capital gain/loss

**Receiving Tips:**

- Ordinary income at value received
- Self-employment tax may apply (15.3% additional)

**Trading VCoins:**

- Every trade is taxable
- Must track cost basis
- Frequent trading = many taxable events

**Your Tax Burden Could Be:**

- 37%+ on earned VCoins (income + self-employment tax)
- 37% on short-term trading gains
- 15-20% on long-term capital gains
- State taxes (varies by state, up to 13% additional)

**Total Possible Tax:** 50%+ of gains

**Example:**
You earn $10,000 in VCoins:

- Federal income tax (24% bracket): $2,400
- Self-employment tax: $1,530
- State tax (5%): $500
- **Total Tax:** $4,430 (44.3%)
- **You Keep:** $5,570

If VCoin price then drops 50% before you sell, you still owe $4,430 in taxes but your VCoins are only worth $5,000.

### 10.2 Reporting Complexity

**Tracking and reporting VCoin transactions is extremely complex.**

**Reporting Requirements:**

**Every Transaction Must Be Tracked:**

- Date and time
- Type (buy, sell, earn, spend)
- Amount in VCoins
- Fair market value in USD at time of transaction
- Cost basis
- Gain or loss

**For Active Users:**

- Hundreds or thousands of transactions annually
- Each tip sent/received is a taxable event
- Each marketplace purchase is a taxable event
- Each trade is a taxable event

**Calculation Challenges:**

- Fair market value at exact time of each transaction
- Cost basis method (FIFO, LIFO, specific identification)
- Tracking across multiple wallets/exchanges
- Converting VCoin price to USD

**Tools Required:**

- Crypto tax software ($50-$500+/year)
- Accountant familiar with crypto ($200-$500/hour)
- Significant time investment

**Penalties for Errors:**

- Underpayment penalties (0.5% per month)
- Interest on unpaid taxes
- Potential audit
- Criminal penalties for tax evasion (if willful)

**IRS Scrutiny:**

- IRS has increased crypto enforcement
- Receives data from exchanges
- Uses blockchain analysis
- Actively auditing crypto transactions

### 10.3 Tax Law Uncertainty

**Crypto tax laws are unclear and changing.**

**Current Uncertainty:**

- IRS guidance incomplete
- Many edge cases unaddressed
- Conflicting interpretations
- State laws vary widely

**Changes Possible:**

- New reporting requirements
- Different tax treatment
- Higher tax rates on crypto
- Retroactive changes (rare but possible)

**International Tax:**

- If you move countries, tax treatment may change
- May owe taxes in multiple countries
- Tax treaties may not cover crypto clearly

**You Risk:**

- Calculating taxes incorrectly
- Penalties for incorrect reporting
- Retroactive tax liability if laws change
- No clear guidance on proper treatment

**Recommendation:**
Consult qualified tax professional experienced with cryptocurrency. Do not rely on this document for tax advice.

### 10.4 Taxable Without Cash

**You may owe taxes on VCoins even if you haven't sold them.**

**Tax Without Cash Flow:**

**Scenario 1 - Earning:**
You earn $10,000 worth of VCoins.

- You owe ~$4,000 in taxes
- You haven't sold VCoins for cash
- Where do you get $4,000 to pay IRS?
- Must sell VCoins (triggering more taxes) or pay from other sources

**Scenario 2 - Appreciation:**
You hold VCoins that appreciate.

- Buy at $0.01, now worth $1.00
- 100x gain on paper
- If you use VCoins to buy something, you owe capital gains tax on 100x gain
- May not have cash to pay taxes

**Scenario 3 - Price Crash:**
You earn $10,000 in VCoins, owe $4,000 in taxes.
Before you sell, price drops 80%.

- VCoins now worth $2,000
- Still owe $4,000 in taxes
- Must pay $4,000 from other funds
- VCoins worth less than taxes owed

**This Happens Frequently:**
Many crypto users faced this in 2017-2018 (big gains in 2017, crash in 2018, taxes due in 2018 on 2017 gains they no longer had).

**Protection (Partial):**

- Sell enough VCoins to cover taxes when earned
- Set aside cash for tax liability
- Don't spend all earned VCoins immediately
- Track tax liability continuously

## 11. THIRD-PARTY RISKS

### 11.1 Solana Blockchain Risk

**VCoin depends entirely on Solana blockchain. Solana problems affect VCoin.**

(See Section 6.2 for detailed blockchain risks)

**Key Points:**

- Solana network outages = VCoin unusable
- Solana failure = VCoin worthless
- No control over Solana network
- Cannot move VCoin to different blockchain easily

### 11.2 Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Risk

**After DEX launch, you'll trade VCoins on decentralized exchanges like Raydium.**

**DEX Risks:**

**Smart Contract Risk:**

- DEX contracts could have bugs
- Exploits could drain liquidity pools
- Your funds at risk when interacting with DEX

**Front-Running:**

- Bots see your transaction before it confirms
- Execute trades ahead of you
- You get worse price
- Common on DEXs, difficult to prevent

**Slippage:**

- Price moves between when you submit trade and when it executes
- Can be 1-20%+ on thin markets
- No protection

**Failed Transactions:**

- Transaction fails but you pay gas fee anyway
- Must retry (pay gas again)
- Price may move against you

**No Customer Support:**

- DEXs are smart contracts, no company behind them
- If something goes wrong, no one to contact
- No reversals, no refunds
- Entirely self-service

**No Protections:**

- No trade halts
- No circuit breakers
- No fraud protection
- No insurance
- You're responsible for every interaction

**Comparison to Centralized Exchanges:**
Centralized (Coinbase): Customer support, insurance, regulatory oversight
Decentralized (Raydium): No support, no insurance, no oversight, more risk

### 11.3 Wallet Provider Risk

**If using self-custody, you depend on wallet software.**

**Wallet Risks:**

**Software Bugs:**

- Wallet has bugs that cause loss of funds
- Incorrect transaction creation
- **Result:** VCoins sent to wrong address or lost

**Any Could Fail:**

- AWS outage = platform down
- Cloudflare issue = site inaccessible
- KYC provider shutdown = cannot verify users
- SendGrid issue = cannot send emails

**Cascading Failures:**

- One failure leads to others
- Platform becomes unusable
- Cannot access VCoins
- **Impact:** Temporary to permanent loss of functionality

**Mitigation (VYRAL's):**

- Redundancy where possible
- Multiple providers for critical services
- Disaster recovery plans
- **But:** Cannot eliminate all third-party risk

---

## 12. CUSTODY RISKS

### 12.1 Custodial Risk

**"Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins":**
Crypto saying meaning: If you don't control private keys, you don't truly own the coins.

**Mitigation:**

- Withdraw to self-custody if concerned
- Only keep VCoins you need for immediate use on platform
- Regularly withdraw excess VCoins
- **But:** Self-custody has own risks (see Section 6.3)

### 12.2 Withdrawal Limitations

**VYRAL may limit or delay withdrawals.**

**Current Limitations:**

- No government guarantee
- Limited legal recourse

**Comparison:**

- Bank deposits: FDIC insured up to $250K
- Stock brokerages: SIPC protected up to $500K
- VYRAL: Zero insurance, zero protection

**Your Risk:**

- Total loss if VYRAL fails
- Cannot diversify away counterparty risk while using custodial service
- Only mitigation: Withdraw to self-custody

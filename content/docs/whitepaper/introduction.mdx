# Introduction

## The Problem with Current Social Media

<Callout type="error" title="Broken Value Distribution">
  The social media industry generates **$220B+ annually**, yet creators receive less than 5% and users get nothing.
</Callout>

### Traditional Social Media Value Flow

The social media industry generates hundreds of billions in annual revenue, yet the value distribution remains fundamentally broken. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X (Twitter) extract enormous value from user-generated content and attention while compensating creators inadequately and offering users no stake in the platform's success.

<Cards>
  <Card title="ðŸ“˜ Facebook">
    **Revenue (2024)**: $150B+

    **Paid to creators**: Less than $5B (3%)
  </Card>
  <Card title="ðŸŽµ TikTok">
    **Revenue (2024)**: $20B+

    **Creator Fund**: $1B (5%)
  </Card>
  <Card title="ðŸ“¸ Instagram">
    **Revenue (2024)**: $50B+

    **Creators get**: Brand deals only
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Critical Problems

Content creators receive a fraction of the advertising revenue they generate, often as little as 30-40%, with the platform retaining the majority. Meanwhile, regular users who drive engagement through likes, comments, and shares receive nothing despite being essential to the platform's value creation.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Unsustainable Creator Income

    Creators lack sustainable income streams, forcing reliance on volatile brand deals and algorithm changes that can devastate earnings overnight.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### No User Control

    Users have no control over platform governance, content moderation, or feature development despite being primary stakeholders.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Data Exploitation

    Centralized platforms collect vast amounts of user data without meaningful compensation or transparency about its use.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Platform Lock-In

    Lack of interoperability forces users to fragment attention across multiple apps, each with closed ecosystems.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout title="Previous Attempts Failed">
  While blockchain demonstrated alternative models are possible, most decentralized social media attempts failed due to **poor UX**, **complex onboarding**, and **unsustainable tokenomics** that prioritize speculation over utility.
</Callout>
